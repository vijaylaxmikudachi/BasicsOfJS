# Basics of JavaScript - ECMAScript Overview

## Project Description

This project provides a comprehensive guide and code samples on ECMAScript (ES) features from ES1 up to ES9. The goal is to serve as a reference for developers to understand JavaScript's evolution, focusing on new language features introduced in each version. By exploring these changes, developers can write more efficient, modern, and maintainable code.

## About ECMAScript

ECMAScript is the scripting language specification that JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript implement. Standardizing JavaScript as ECMAScript ensures consistency in the language across various platforms. Each ECMAScript release introduces new features, syntax, and optimizations that enhance JavaScript's capabilities.

## ECMAScript Versions

### ES1 to ES5

**ES1 (1997) through ES5 (2009)** form the foundation of JavaScript, with features like:

- Basic syntax (ES1) and object-oriented capabilities (ES3).
- `strict mode` (ES5) to improve code reliability and security.
- `Array`, `String`, and `Object` methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
- JSON support (ES5).

### ES6 (ES2015) - The Big Update

ES6 brought significant changes and is widely considered the most impactful update in JavaScript's history. Major features include:

1. **Let and Const**: New variable declarations that respect block scope.
2. **Arrow Functions**: Shortened syntax for functions with implicit returns.
3. **Template Literals**: Multi-line strings and expressions within strings using backticks.
4. **Destructuring**: Extracting values from arrays and objects into distinct variables.
5. **Classes**: A more convenient syntax for creating objects and inheritance.
6. **Modules**: Native support for modular code using `import` and `export`.
7. **Promises**: Simplifies asynchronous code handling.
8. **Default Parameters**: Function parameters can now have default values.

### ES7 (ES2016)

ES7 was a smaller update but added essential features to streamline coding:

1. **Array.prototype.includes()**: Checks if an array contains a specific element.
2. **Exponentiation Operator**: Simplifies exponentiation calculations with **ude:

### ES8 (ES2017)
ES8 introduced more powerful features for object handling and async operations:

1. **Async/Await**: Simplifies handling of promises, allowing asynchronous code to look synchronous.
2. **Object.entries() and Object.values()**: Convert an objectâ€™s properties to arrays.
3. **String Padding**: Adds padStart and padEnd for string padding.

### ES9 (ES2018)
ES9 added features to enhance asynchronous processing and object management:

1. **Async Iteration**: The for await...of loop to handle asynchronous data sources.
2. **Object Rest/Spread Properties**: Expands object handling with spread ... operator.
3. **Promise.prototype.finally()**: Adds a finally method to promises for cleanup actions.
